## Throttling requests

There's opt-in support for throttling requests to the endpoint.

```js
const withThrottling = require('hafas-client/throttle')
const createClient = require('hafas-client')
const dbProfile = require('hafas-client/p/db')

// create a throttled HAFAS client with Deutsche Bahn profile
const createThrottledClient = withThrottling(createClient)
const client = createThrottledClient(dbProfile, 'my-awesome-program')

// Berlin Jungfernheide to München Hbf
client.journeys('8011167', '8000261', {results: 1})
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error)
```

You can pass custom values for the nr of requests (`limit`) per interval into `withThrottling`:

```js
// 2 requests per second
const createThrottledClient = withThrottling(createClient, 2, 1000)
const client = createThrottledClient(dbProfile, 'my-awesome-program')
```

## Retrying failed requests

There's opt-in support for retrying failed requests to the endpoint.

```js
const withRetrying = require('hafas-client/retry')
const createClient = require('hafas-client')
const dbProfile = require('hafas-client/p/db')

// create a client with Deutsche Bahn profile that will retry on HAFAS errors
const createRetryingClient = withRetrying(createClient)
const client = createRetryingClient(dbProfile, 'my-awesome-program')

// Berlin Jungfernheide to München Hbf
client.journeys('8011167', '8000261', {results: 1})
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error)
```

You can pass custom options into `withRetrying`. They will be passed into [`retry`](https://github.com/tim-kos/node-retry#tutorial).

```js
// retry 2 times, after 10 seconds & 30 seconds
const createRetryingClient = withRetrying(createClient, {
	retries: 2,
	minTimeout: 10 * 1000,
	factor: 3
})
const client = createRetryingClient(dbProfile, 'my-awesome-program')
```
